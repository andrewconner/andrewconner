This is a bold claim about reality, so to get those of us there, he walks through a journey of what we know about our universe and how we know it. More importantly, he builds to focus on what the same mathematical underpinnings we use <em>in</em> our universe predict about things we can't directly observe.</p><p>To get anywhere close to explaining his ultimate theory, he spends sufficient time explaining the cosmos, with successes and failures of previous theories, so even a non-academic can understand where multiverses came about.</p><p>Part &ldquo;introduction to the cosmos&rdquo;, part memoir, part philosophy, Tegmark's journey is brilliant and enjoyable.

Despite living a short drive from Sand Hill for the past 7 years, I've never seen something written that's so clear.

· <a href=#ratings class=rating>Rating: B+</a></aside><p>Frankly, it's hard to find balance on many issues that directly support or reject specific world-views. Evolution is a prime example. <a href=https://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/>Nearly all scientists</a> feel there is sufficient evidence for natural selection and evolution—including in humans—as the explanation of species breadth we see today. However, only 9% of white evangelicals agree. Even more surprising, each side is highly confident in their conclusion. They have arguments supporting their view, but it seems that neither side fully understands the other.</p><p>The result is a lot of talk past each other. Evolution is complicated and the evidence is nuanced. It's easy to construct a straw man argument that misinterprets the opposing position and then proceed to tear it down. Instead, if we genuinely are interested in truth, we must <a href=https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FhH8m5n8qGSSHsAgG/better-disagreement>steel man arguments</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in understanding evolution, either because you don't have a firm grasp of what arguments are being made—and more importantly, why people believe them—or because you think scientists are misguided, <em>Why Evolution is True</em> is the best book I've come across to clearly outline the central claims and supporting evidence. Coyne covers precisely what scientists mean by &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;, falsifiable and verifiable claims that have been made, what we would find that might discredit the theory, and what we have found after hypotheses were made. Throughout the book, he reviews battery of evidence we've found, spanning geology, genetics, the fossil record, biology, and more. If you come into it not believing in evolution, put aside any arrogance you detect from the author while reading the book. If you already believe in evolution, keep a flexible mind about what we know and what is very hard to test.</p></div><div class="inline-review review"><h2 class=review-title id=radical-markets><a href=https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0691177503 target=_blank><span class=primary-title>Radical Markets</span><span class=subtitle>: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=link-out src=https://andrewconner.com/img/link.svg></a></h2><aside class="meta inline"><span class=author-name>Eric A.

· <a href=#ratings class=rating>Rating: C+</a></aside><p>If you believe that markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources, what if their breadth was extended to be <em>far</em> beyond how they're used today? Posner and Weyl play with this concept, and deliver proposals outside the current political axis, leaving people of nearly every political persuasion both interested and aghast.</p><p>I'll focus on the proposal they get the most attention for, regarding property ownership. They offer an economic system that would implement a wealth tax, levied on all personal property valued at whatever you publicly declare its value to be. Except, anyone can immediately take ownership of anything of yours by exceeding your named price. This incentivizes accurate valuations, and encourages the optimal use of resources. If you undervalue property because you're underutilizing it, someone else can quite easily arbitrage this spread.</p><p>This is one of four <em>radical</em> ideas they present using markets. The others involve voting, immigration, corporate control, and data ownership.</p><p>Here's the generous interpretation: their book is an interesting philosophy of economics, rather than literal ideas that could be adopted wholesale. That interpretation fueled many interesting hypothetical discussions I've had recently. However, for me—a fairly layperson—there's significant flaws with many of them, but they're interesting to think about and guide how we build our future.</p></div><div class="inline-review review"><h2 class=review-title id=stillness-is-the-key><a href=https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0525538585 target=_blank><span class=primary-title>Stillness Is the Key</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=link-out src=https://andrewconner.com/img/link.svg></a></h2><aside class="meta inline"><span class=author-name>Ryan Holiday</span>

So, I had this one pre-ordered since it was announced. Stoicism, virtue ethics, and meditation? I'm in.</p><blockquote><p>Each of us has access to more information than we could reasonably use. We tell ourselves that it's part of our job, that we have to be &ldquo;on top of things,&rdquo; and so we give up precious time to news reports, meetings, and other forms of feedback&mldr; We must stop this.</p><p>&ldquo;If you wish to improve,&rdquo; Epictetus once said, &ldquo;be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.&rdquo;
<cite>Ryan Holiday, _<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Stillness-Key-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0525538585>Stillness is the Key</a>_</cite></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, it did none of these well. It starts well, with several brilliant quotes, and it often dips into great insights. Some of my favorite chapters include thoughtful historical stories of leaders who valued stillness in hard situations. As a whole, though, it never came together into a cohesive unit.</p><p>Past half way, it seems to fall apart. The chapters are full of appeals to the bandwagon — if lots of smart people did <em>X</em>, then <em>X</em> is worth doing. His understanding of history is incomplete, which only tripped my detector when I realized that many historical counterexamples to his point were oddly left out. Furthermore, the structure of the book left overlapping ideas in disjoint sections to fit the &ldquo;mind&rdquo;, &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;, &ldquo;body&rdquo; form he chose.</p><p>If you're new to Stoicism, you'll pick up a lot.

· <a href=#ratings class=rating>Rating: B+</a></aside><p>Yuval Noah Harari narrates the history of human kind, starting from pre-history with many types of <em>sapiens</em> roaming the world, to modern days. Large popular works often make for wide targets of criticism—which you'd see about <em>Sapiens</em> if you looked around. There's a lot to be critical of, but for me—uneducated in much of the anthropology and sociology underpinnings—there's also a lot to take away. Frankly, many of the vocal criticisms miss the point. Harari's greatest flaw is how he narrates as if detached from what he speaks about, as an unaffiliated observer reporting facts and observations; however, he frequently mixes well-agreed history with his opinions.</p><p>Taking a step back, his story telling led to many new revelations for me, even though many of the facts weren't all that surprising. For example, in the beginning he talks of human's ability to believe and live by <em>fictions</em>; we build our whole society based on them. Money, companies, countries, society, equality, rights, etc. are all constructs that we join together to believe. We're the only species that does this.</p><p>I learned a lot, and enjoyed the read. If you're willing to keep a skeptical mind and understand that much of this is Harari's own opinions, you'll likely enjoy it as well.</p></div><div class="inline-review review"><h2 class=review-title id=how-not-to-die><a href=https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Die-Discover-Scientifically/dp/1250066115 target=_blank><span class=primary-title>How Not to Die</span><span class=subtitle>: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=link-out src=https://andrewconner.com/img/link.svg></a></h2><aside class="meta inline"><span class=author-name>Dr. Michael Greger and Gene Stone</span>

Lots to love: Dr. Greger is motivated to help people be healthy and live longer; there's nothing else. The first part of the book looks at all the top modern killers (heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, &mldr;), and gives evidence supporting plant-based diets. It's very well cited, and he's quite intelligent. Just like when reading Keto books, there's almost this underlying conspiratorial overlay on much of the evidence. Our science is largely funded by the food industry, who are in charge of informing policymakers of latest science. So, we end up with monoculture foods, sickly animals, and sugar-packed diets. The latter part of the book was more enjoyable for me, because it gave practical advice. I've increased my berry, spice (especially turmeric), and flexseed consumption based on the evidence he cites.</p><p>Frustrated: the science is cherry picked to form the larger point: you should be vegan, or at least vegetarian. I don't think it's <em>wrong</em>, but feels incomplete. If he disagrees with other modern research, such as with saturated fat consumption or the role of dietary cholesterol in blood cholesterol, he should have confronted it directly. Instead, it's just assumed that dietary saturated fat and cholesterol are awful. Absolute vs relative risk is frequently ignored for many risk factors. The chapter on diabetes spends more time talking about saturated fat than sugar. So, lots to learn from, but feels a bit dogmatic.</p></div><div class="inline-review review"><h2 class=review-title id=high-growth-handbook><a href=https://www.amazon.com/High-Growth-Handbook-Elad-Gil/dp/1732265100 target=_blank><span class=primary-title>High Growth Handbook</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=link-out src=https://andrewconner.com/img/link.svg></a></h2><aside class="meta inline"><span class=author-name>Elad Gil</span>

Well, this would rank a 1.5m tall obese person as &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; than a 1.6m very thin person. By weight? This has the same problem. As it turns out, &ldquo;size&rdquo; is jagged.

Instead, he sees a future where full patient context can be used to provide personalized, targeted care.</p></div><div class="inline-review review"><h2 class=review-title id=free-will><a href=https://www.amazon.com/Free-Will-Deckle-Edge-Harris/dp/1451683405 target=_blank><span class=primary-title>Free Will</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=link-out src=https://andrewconner.com/img/link.svg></a></h2><aside class="meta inline"><span class=author-name>Sam Harris</span>

This one's short, and is <em>okay</em>. His arguments are not the most intellectually rigorous, but I'm not sure that was his intention. Rather than an exploration of determinism, his goal is to show that if you look closely for &ldquo;the one who thinks,&rdquo; it disappears. Thoughts appear in consciousness, and the autonomy we believe we have is an illusion — in fact, the illusion isn't even there. If you haven't explored this, it's a hard concept to grasp. If this sounds like gobbledygook, you'll likely get little from this book. Much of the content in <em>Free Will</em> overlaps with <a href=https://wakingup.com/>his meditation app</a>, and I'd recommend that instead to approach these ideas.</p></div><div class="inline-review review"><h2 class=review-title id=the-art-of-gathering><a href=https://www.amazon.com/Art-Gathering-How-Meet-Matters/dp/1594634920 target=_blank><span class=primary-title>The Art of Gathering</span><span class=subtitle>: How We Meet and Why It Matters</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=link-out src=https://andrewconner.com/img/link.svg></a></h2><aside class="meta inline"><span class=author-name>Priya Parker</span>

It's both the story of his career as the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, but also about the world we live in. How do we effectively deliver and fight for justice? How do our leaders affect its grasp?</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[T]he rule of law&rdquo; and &ldquo;due process&rdquo; and &ldquo;presumed innocent&rdquo; seem to do service these days more as political slogans than as bedrock principles… It seems preferred these days to demonize one's opponents rather than engage them, to bludgeon critics rather than win them over. There is a creeping contempt for truth and expertise… And the concept of justice seems turned on its head—holding different meaning depending on whether you are a political adversary or ally.</p></blockquote><p>We're not left with too many solutions, and at times it's worrying.

How do people around the world—with different and contradictory beliefs—have spiritual experiences?
